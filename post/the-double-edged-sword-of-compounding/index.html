    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Starting with this post, I want to venture into a new area — investing — distinct from my usual topics of computer vision, deep learning, etc. Investing has become my latest hobby, and after diving into it, I have found it both fascinating and inspiring.</p>
<p>In this first post, I will explore a fundamental concept in the world of investing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">compound interest</a>. To me, it represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">&ldquo;first principle&rdquo;</a> of investing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-compound-interest">What is Compound Interest?</h2>
<p>Compound interest is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest">interest</a>. When you deposit money into a bank account or lend it to someone, you typically earn interest. The amount you deposit or lend is called the <em>principal</em>, and the interest is calculated as a percentage (<em>interest rate</em>) of the principal. For example, if you have a principal of $100 and an interest rate of 10%, your interest would be $10 ($100 x 10% = $10).</p>
<p>Interest is typically paid at fixed intervals. In the example above, let&rsquo;s assume the $10 is paid annually. After the first year, you would have $100 in principal and $10 in interest. Now, imagine that the $10 interest is added to the $100 principal. This means that, in the next period, interest will be calculated based on the new principal amount of $110. If the interest rate remains at 10%, your next interest payment will be $11 ($110 * 10% = $11).</p>
<p>Here, you may notice a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_effect">snowball effect</a>: as your interest payments are added to your principal (increasing it from $100 to $110), your interest payments also grow (from $10 to $11). This cycle continues, with the interest added to your principal, which increases the principal further, leading to higher interest payments and, in turn, an even higher principal, and so on.</p>
<p>If we continue the above calculations for 10 years, the principals and interest amounts would look as follows (with rounding errors). The principal is the amount at the beginning of each year, and the interest is the amount at the end of each year. The principal for year n+1 is the principal of year n plus the interest earned in year n.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-of-compound-interest">The magic of Compound Interest</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it&hellip; he who doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; pays it.&rdquo; - Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the numbers in the table above, you might realize the magic of compound interest: starting with $100 in principal, earning 10% interests per year, by the beginning of the 9th year, you have doubled your money. If this doesn&rsquo;t amaze you, let&rsquo;s explore two more calculations to help you fully appreciate it.</p>
<h3 id="compounding-for-another-10-years">Compounding for Another 10 Years</h3>

<p>As you can see, at the beginning of the 10th year, your principal is around $236. By the start of the 20th year, it has grown (non-linearly) to approximately $612. Continuing the calculations, by the 26th year, you will receive an interest payment of $108.35, the first time your interest payment exceeds your initial $100 principal! The longer you continue the calculations, the wilder the numbers become.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-of-non-compounding">The Case of Non-Compounding</h3>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s consider the non-compounding case, where the annual interest payment is not added back to the principal. In this scenario, you receive interest based on the initial $100 principal, meaning you earn $10 in interest each year. After 10 years, your total amount would be $200 ($100 + $100 x 0.1 x 10). While this is not too far from the compounded case, where your total would be around $260, the gap widens significantly after another 10 years. In the non-compounding case, you would have $300, while in the compounding case, you would have approximately $672. As before, the longer you continue the calculations, the more drastic the gap becomes.</p>
<h3 id="exponential-explosion">Exponential Explosion</h3>
<p>The snowball effect of compound interest described above is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth">exponential growth</a>, or more dramatically, <a href="https://www.stewartmath.com/dp_fops_samples/dp7.html">exponential explosion</a>. This is the essence of the magic of compound interest — over time, the amount of your money grows exponentially to a &ldquo;formidable&rdquo; sum (though not so dramatic in the example above, largely due to the small $100 principal).</p>
<p>If we plot the results of compounding versus non-compounding over 50 years, the &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; or magic of compound interest becomes much more evident. After 50 years, your initial $100 principal grows to around $11,739! And remember, this 117-fold growth comes from a &ldquo;modest&rdquo; 10% compound interest rate. Take a moment to think about it: a 117-times increase from just 0.1, and you will start to appreciate the magic of compound interest. By comparison, in the non-compounding case, it would take 1,164 years to grow to $11,739!</p>
<p><img src="/post/the-double-edged-sword-of-compounding/compound.png"></p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the non-compounding case is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest#Simple_interest">simple interest</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-care-about-compound-interest">Why Care About Compound Interest</h2>
<p>Now that we have a clear understanding of compound interest, why is it important to investing? The answer is simple: it describes your return on investment. If you are familiar with investing, you have likely heard terms like &ldquo;the annualized rate of return is X% over the past Y years&rdquo;. This &ldquo;annualized rate of return&rdquo; is similar (but not identical) to the compound interest rate we discussed earlier. As we have seen, compound interest has the magic to grow your money into a formidable sum over time.</p>
<h3 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h3>
<p>While the &ldquo;annualized rate of return&rdquo; is similar to the compound interest rate in our example, there is a crucial difference that often leads to misconceptions. In our compound interest example, the 10% interest rate is fixed every year. However, in real-world investing, the rate is rarely, if ever, fixed. For instance, an annualized rate of return of 10% does NOT mean you are guaranteed to earn 10% each year! Instead, the annualized rate of return is calculated by comparing the starting and ending values of an investment over a given time period and determining the equivalent compound interest rate.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the details of this computation, you can refer to <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/wealth-management/annualized-rate-of-return">this article</a>. It is crucial for all investors to dispel this misconception (even smart people can fall into this trap) and set realistic expectations.</p>
<h2 id="why-compounding-is-a-double-edged-sword">Why Compounding Is a Double-Edged Sword</h2>
<p>From the discussions above, I hope you now appreciate the magic of compounding in investing. However, it is equally important to understand why compounding can become a double-edged sword. The reason is simple: while compounding can work wonders, it can also work against you.</p>
<p>In the real world, investing is not free. While the market might generate an annualized return of 10%, you don&rsquo;t get to keep all of it. A portion is deducted as investment costs. A common example of such costs is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_expense_ratio">total expense ratio</a> (TER) of investment funds, where you pay a percentage of your money to the fund providers each year. When it comes to costs, compounding works against you.</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the compound interest example of 10% and consider a principal of $10,000. Suppose the TER is 1%. After one year, your gross amount would grow to $11,000 ($10,000 * 10%). However, you would pay $100 ($10,000 * 1%) in fees to the fund providers, leaving you with a net amount of $10,900. Effectively, your net compound interest rate is 9%. This leads to the following simple formula:</p>
<p>Net annualized rate of return = Gross annualized rate of return - Total expense ratio</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Investment return rate = Market return rate - Total expense ratio</p>
<p>Now, let’s perform similar calculations to compare a 10% market return with a 9% investment return. Specifically, we will calculate the total asset value (with rounding errors) at 10-year intervals for both cases.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Years</th>
<th>Market Value (10%, $)</th>
<th>Investment Value (9%, $)</th>
<th>Percentage of Market Value Kept by Investment (%)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>25,937.42</td>
<td>23673.64</td>

<td>743,575.20</td>
<td>63.34</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From the table, it is clear that over time, you retain less and less of the market value. After 10 years, you keep over 91%, but after 50 years, this drops to just over 63%. In other words, after 10 years, you lose around 9% of the market value, and after 50 years, the loss grows to 37%. Where does this 37% go? You guessed it - it&rsquo;s taken as fees.</p>
<p>Now, consider this: the 37% loss stems from a seemingly &ldquo;small&rdquo; 1% annual fee. To better understand the impact, let’s calculate the total amount of fees you paid to fund providers over time.</p>
<table>

<th>Market Value (10%, $)</th>

<th>Investment Fees (%)</th>

<td>1,173,908.53</td>
<td>743,575.20</td>
<td>430,333.32</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown, over 50 years, you pay a staggering $430,333 in fees to fund providers — more than 43 times your initial $10,000 principal! And again, this immense cost results from a seemingly &ldquo;small&rdquo; 1% annual fee.</p>
<p>By now, it should be clear: costs also compound, and over time, they can amount to a formidable sum. This is why compounding can be a double-edged sword.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-the-double-edged-sword">How to Avoid the Double-Edged Sword</h3>
<p>The solution is simple: minimize investment costs, or at the very least, reduce them to a level you can accept. For instance, if the fund cost were magically reduced to a TER of 0.03% (and such funds do exist), you would still be able to retain over 98% of the market value after 50 years!</p>

<h3 id="is-my-fund-cost-high">Is My Fund Cost High?</h3>
<p>I have seen people ask this question when evaluating whether to select a fund: &ldquo;Is this X% fund cost high?&rdquo; To answer this, you can simply repeat the calculations I provided earlier. Determine the percentage of money that you will need to pay to fund providers over your investment horizon and decide whether that cost is acceptable to you. If you find it unacceptable, the fund cost might be considered high, and you may want to consider looking for one with lower fees.</p>
